# How to use this README

This file is your team’s **working project document**.

You must keep updating it throughout the 4-week build period.  
By the final review, this README should clearly show:
- your idea,
- your planning,
- your design decisions,
- your technical process,
- your build progress,
- your testing,
- your failures and changes,
- your final outcome.

## Rules
- Fill every section.
- Do not delete headings.
- If something does not apply, write `Not applicable` and explain why.
- Add images, screenshots, sketches, links, and videos wherever useful.
- Update task status and weekly logs regularly.
- Use this file as evidence of process, not only as a final report.

## 1.3 Project Title
BatManor

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch
`A fast-paced pixel-art interactive game where Batman navigates a chaotic manor while player control survival through real-time physical inputs.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea
In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:
- what your project is,
- what kind of playful experience it creates,
- what makes it fun, curious, engaging, strange, satisfying, competitive, or delightful,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
`[The project is a 2D pixel-art interactive game system** where Batman moves continuously across a chaotic manor, and the player must help him dodge obstacles such as buildings, enemies, and projectiles. The system combines screen-based gameplay with physical interaction** using sensors/buttons connected to an ESP32.

The experience is designed to befast,reactive and playable, emphasizing reflexes and timing. The pixel aesthetic creates nostalgia, while the physical interaction introduces embodiment, making it more engaging than a purely digital game.]`

- What is the experience?
- What do you want the player or participant to feel?
- Why would someone want to try it again?

**Response:**  
`[- Experience: Fast reflex-based dodging game
- Feeling: Tension, urgency, satisfaction after survival
- Replay value: Increasing difficulty and complexity advances levels]`

## 2.3 Design Persona
Complete the sentence below:

> We are designing this project as if we are a small creative studio making a **[toy / game / playable object / interactive experience]** for **[children / teens / adults / classmates / exhibition visitors / mixed audience]**.

# 3. Inspiration

## 3.1 References
List what inspired the project.

| Source Type | Title / Link | What Inspired You |
|---|---|---|
| `[Video Game/ Website / Object]` | `[Flappy Bird]` | `[Simple but addictive loop]` |
| `[Video Game]` | `[Jetpack Joyride]` | `[Continuous motion gameplay]` |

## 3.2 Original Twist
What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
`[The integration of physical controls (joystick buttons/sensors) with a digital pixel with the illusion carried by the mirror , game creates a hybrid interaction,which ]`

---

# 4. Project Intent

## 4.1 Core Interaction Loop
Describe the main loop of interaction.

Examples:
- press → launch → score → reset
- connect → control → observe → repeat
- turn → trigger → react → repeat
- move object → sensor detects → sound/light response → player reacts

**Response:**  
- press using joystick on console → launch → move using console
- observe →  dodge snipers → attack to kill  → movement detected  → light response (neopixel)
- levels advance  → complexity increased  → repeat
## 4.2 Intended Player / Audience

| Question | Response |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | `[Students / exhibition visitors / young adults / millennials ]` |
| Age range | `[10–35]` |
| Solo or multiplayer | `[Solo]` |
| Expected duration of one round | `[30–60 seconds per round]` |
| What should the player feel? | `[Tension and excitement]` |
| Is explanation required before use? | `[Minimal/ Adapting to console controls]` |

## 4.3 Player Journey
Describe exactly how a player will use the project.

1. **Approach:** `[appears as a mirror / after approaching screen turns on - turning it into a display]`
2. **Start:** `[Press button to begin the game]`
3. **First Action:** `[Moving using the console to move around the manor.]`
4. **Main Interaction:** `[The Batman progresses as it dodges and tries to kill the ghosts ]`
5. **System Response:** `[Every strike of the flare, every movement in the game has a sensory reaction through the neopixel strips ]`
6. **Win / Lose / End Condition:** `[With each level, the difficulty increases as the number of ghosts rises and their flare activity becomes more intense, making evasion progressively more challenging. The game follows an endless progression model with no fixed ending—players continue advancing through levels until all four lives are lost.]`
7. **Reset:** `[Left Joystick reset button enables a restart of the game]`
